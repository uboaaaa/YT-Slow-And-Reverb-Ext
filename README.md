# YouTube Slow and Reverb Controls
...is a small extension for Firefox that lets the user control the speed and reverb of YouTube videos. I made this so I wouldn't have to resort to finding "Slow + Reverb" remixes of songs I like. It's my first extension, so it's a litle garbo. I'd like to rewrite the scripts at some point so they're less spaghetti-ey. Made with pure JS, HTML + CSS and tears.

# Instructions
- Pin the extension to your toolbar.
- Head to a tab that's playing a YouTube video.
- Adjust playback rate and reverb to heart's content.
